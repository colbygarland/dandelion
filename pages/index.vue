            <p class="mb-3">I'm a busy mother of four beautiful children. We live in a small, small, small northern Alberta community. Both my husband and I, and our parents, and our grandparents grew up here. We've known each other since grade 2 and graduated with 12 students in our class.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Moose, bears, foxes, and other wildlife are constantly in our back yard and they love my chickens... Ah, life on the prairie. I've always loved wildflowers, one thats always in my yard is the famous bright yellow dandelion. My brother in-law has nicknamed me little house on the prairie for multiple reasons!</p>
            <p class="mb-3">I recently had an idea, Canada needs their own subscription box with Canadian made products, or at least as many as possible. So an idea was born and a name finally came to me, Dandelion on the Prairie. Here I try to find Canadian made products that are sustainable, ethically made or natural. 4-6 items shipped to you monthly so you don't have to wait too long!</p>
            <p class="mb-3">So along with my tech savvy brother in-law, Colby, welcome to the Dandelion on the prairie family. Stayed tuned for our launch date!</p>
