                    <p class="mb-3 leading-loose">I am a busy mother of four beautiful children. We live in a small, small, small, northern Alberta community. Both my husband and I, our parents, and our grandparents, call this home. My husband and I have known each other since grade two. We graduated together, along  with 10 other students in our class.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3 leading-loose">Moose, bear, fox, and other wildlife are constantly in our back yard and they love my chickens! Ah, life on the prairie! I've always loved wildflowers. The one, that is always in my yard, is the famous, bright yellow dandelion. My brother in-law has nicknamed me, Little House  on the Prairie,  for a number of valid reasons!</p>
                    <p class="mb-3 leading-loose">I recently had an idea! I believe that Canada needs its own subscription box, filled with Canadian made products! An idea was born and a name finally came to me; Dandelion on the Prairie. Here, I will try to source Canadian made products that are sustainable and ethically made or natural. Three to five items will be shipped to you monthly. Your wait time will be minimal!</p>
                    <p class="mb-3 leading-loose">I, along with my tech savvy brother in-law, Colby, would like to welcome you to the Dandelion on the Prairie family. Stayed tuned for our launch date!</p>
